# P1: Movie Trailer Website.
This is my first project in the [Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree) program.

* my_movies.py -- the script
* main.tpl -- webpage template
* head.htm -- css and js code, which is included to a header of the webpage
  
## Running the script
To run this script you will need a [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) interpreter installed. The script was tested with Python_2.7 and Python_3.4.
  
Clone this repo with command `git clone https://github.com/sergey-lance/Udacity-FSWDN-P1` or download a [.zip archive](https://github.com/sergey-lance/Udacity-FSWDN-P1/archive/master.zip).
